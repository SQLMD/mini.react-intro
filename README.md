# React CRUD App
### This was created during my time as a [Code Chrysalis](https://codechrysalis.io) Student

## Set-Up

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Run the app:

```

```

To view, go to `localhost:8080`.

## Questions

1.  When we run `yarn serve`, what is being done?
1.  Look at our `index.html` file. Where is `bundle.js` coming from?
1.  What is `.jsx`?
1.  Can you make sense of what is in `webpack.config.js`?
